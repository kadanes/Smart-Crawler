The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , learning , natural language processing , perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain .Neural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. [k] In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related M&A in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015. Deep feedforward neural networks[ edit ] According to one overview, the expression "Deep Learning" was introduced to the Machine Learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986 [232] and gained traction after
Igor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to Artificial Neural Networks in 2000. Recent exhibitions showcasing the usage of AI to produce art include the Google-sponsored benefit and auction at the Gray Area Foundation in San Francisco, where artists experimented with the deepdream algorithm [309] and the exhibition "Unhuman: Art in the Age of AI," which took place in Los Angeles and Frankfurt in the fall of 2017. Machine ethics[ edit ] The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making. [187] ^ Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables ^ The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s ^ SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s ^ Naive Bayes is reportedly the "most widely used learner" at Google, due in part to its scalability. Qualification problem :
While McCarthy was primarily concerned with issues in the logical representation of actions, Russell & Norvig 2003 apply the term to the more general issue of default reasoning in the vast network of assumptions underlying all our commonsense knowledge. ^ Artificial brain arguments: AI requires a simulation of the operation of the human brain
A few of the people who make some form of the argument:
The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by Clark Glymour in the mid-1970s and was touched on by Zenon Pylyshyn and John Searle in 1980.
