Paper bags are environment friendly alternates for plastic bags and can be done quickly. Glimpse of the Paper Bag: For this you will need: Chart paper (or any other thick paper) Glue Scissors Handle for the bag Punching machine Colors Paper bags for everyday use can be done with simple brown paper. I’ve used chart paper for this tutorial to replicate the bag I made for last year’s environment day campaign. How To: Step 1: Take a piece of chart paper and make a crease at the center. Step 2: Paste the two sides together with glue. Allow it to dry for some time. Step 3: Fold both sides of the paper. The thickness of the fold will determine the space inside the bag; this will become the width of the bag so accordingly make the fold. Step 4: Open the folds and along the creases made fold inwards on both the sides as shown. Step 5: Fold the bottom of the bag for a length of around 2 inches. This will depend on the size of the bag you are making. Step 6: Unfold the last fold made. Along the side crease fold inwards to form a triangular shaped edge. Step 7: Fold the flap inwards and flatten it as shown below. Paste the two flaps together using glue and press so that the base is firm. Step 8: Using a punching machine make two holes on both sides of the bag to attach the handle. Step 9: If the bag is plain looking and you want to add some color to it use watercolors or poster colors to add some designs to the bag. Alternatively you can use cut gift wrappers to jazz up your bag a little. Step 10: Attach a handle to the bag using the holes made. I wanted to use earthy colors so I went for brown beads. You can attach simple plastic or thread handles to the bag as well. This is a simple process and a bag can be done well within ten to fifteen minutes. You can do these bags for everyday use from glossy pages of magazine or newspapers. It can be be a useful and interesting craft activity for kids during the holidays or for a craft project. 2011-06-20 Ramya tweet Previous: Acrylic Nails Next: Starry Night (1889) You might also like...

If you enjoy cooking and other aspects of food then starting a home-based food-related business might be for you. To sell edibles there might a few extra hoops you need to jump through in starting your business. Most states have regulations around the food industry that involve keeping your personal cooking tools and ingredients separate from your business ones and the possibility of a visit from the health department. Your state’s health department or occupational regulations website should have information on what’s involved in creating a selling food.​​ These 7 ideas involve cooking or sharing your love of food and making a living from it. So grab a cup of coffee and a muffin (or another treat to eat) and check out these foodie business ideas. 01 Create and Sell Baked Goods Anwar Hussein Collection/ROTA / Gety Images People love baked items. They have muffins bread or donuts for breakfast bread with lunch a bread or biscuit with dinner and cookies or cakes for dessert. You can profit from the love of baked goods by baking them and selling them yourself. You can specialize in a specific baked item such as starting a cookie business or you can bake a wide range of treats such as cakes muffins breads and more. You can further niche by baking gluten-free or other diet-specialty treats (i.e. sugar-free). You can consign your baked goods and sell them through a local cafe or shop or you can sell them direct to consumers through an online bake shop or farmers market. 02 Specialty Goods Nicola Tree/Getty Images Do you have a special item you make that others love? Maybe you make jams or preserves? Do you roast your own coffee beans? Can you make chocolate and other confections? If you have an edible item you make that others enjoy turn it into income. Similar to baked goods specialty items are in demand. They make great gifts or treats that can be sold through consignment online at fairs and farmers markets and more. 03 Catering Hero Images/Getty Images Do you enjoy cooking a variety of foods for events? Although catering can be a big task many caterers got their start working on weekends catering for smaller events. In fact you might consider specializing in a niche such as a type of event or specific foods. Odds are you’ll need a few extra helping hands on the day of the event to ensure all items are prepared and ready to be served at the allotted time. 04 Personal Chef fcafotodigita/Getty Images Maybe you enjoy cooking but don’t want to take on the large task of serving a group through catering. Another option is to be a personal chef. Busy families often don’t have the time or desire to cook and hire others to create well-balanced healthy meals for them. Many personal chefs cook in bulk leaving a week’s worth of food with their clients. Some cook at the client’s home while others deliver. You can consider specializing as well. For example you can cook for families with special needs such as allergy-restricted diets. 05 Cooking Instructor Hero Images/Getty Images Many people wish they had skills in the kitchen and are willing to pay to learn. Like other culinary jobs a cooking instructor can focus on a specific area such as baking or grilling or be a generalist. You can lead cooking instruction in your home or have someone videotape you and you can sell the videos as part of a home-learning course. Another option is to create your own cooking show posted on YouTube which can pay you advertising income. 06 Nutrition Coach RTimages/Getty Images People are becoming more and more concerned about their health and the role food plays in feeling good. A nutrition coach helps others design and follow an eating plan that helps them meet their health goals. Some clients may have specific issues to contend with such as diabetes or food allergies. Other may want to follow a specific type of diet such as vegan or gluten-free. Although you don’t need to be a registered dietitian or nutritionist it can add to your credibility and allow to charge more. Or you can consider getting certified as a nutrition coach by one of the many nutrition coaching companies. 07 Foodie Blogger Amparo E. Rios/Getty Images One of the fastest and easiest ways to get started making money from the love of food is through a food blog. You can share your recipes through text or video and post them on your blog share them on Pinterest and more. Unlike other food businesses that are under special regulation a food blog doesn’t have special food rules because you’re not selling the food items. Instead you can earn income through a variety of other options such as affiliate marketing advertising or creating your own products such as a cookbook .

More About Passion Make » Diya are traditional oil lamps of India. The Diya are very elegant and simple to make too. When lit they give a peaceful ray of light. During Diwali which is the festival of light every Indian homes are lit with Diya (Oil Lamps) which is such a beautiful sight to see. Decorative Oil Lamps are used for many auspicious occasions and are of religious significane. Here I am going to show you how to make a Diya (Oil Lamp) at home with ease. Traditionally they are made with clay. Here I have used wheat Flour. I have decorated and painted the hand made Diya in a traditional way. You can also create your own Diya with customized design of your choice. :) Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 1: Ingredients To make - 3 Oil Lamps (Diya) Ingredients: Wheat Flour - 1/2 Cup Water - Enough to knead Oil - 1/4 Cup Cotton Wick - 3 (or) Cotton cloth - 3 Thin Strips as shown in the picture Fabric Paint Beads and Mirrors (Any decorative items) Glue Paint Brush Equipment: Oven Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 2: Knead Take the wheat flour in a bowl. Add water little by little and knead it. Knead the dough till it forms a ball. It should be slightly tight and not too soft. Adjust the water in such a way. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 3: Shape Divide the dough into three parts. Shape it into the traditional Diya shape. The tip should be pinched. This is where the wick will be placed and lit. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 4: Bake Grease the Baking pan. Preheat the oven at 200 degree Celsius. Place the Diya on the Baking dish. Bake for 15 minutes at 200 degree Celsius. Check in between. If the base has puffed up slightly the just push it down gently with a spoon. When the Diya are hard and stiff take it out of the oven.

Temple design is a traditional design of India. I chose to use creme beads. I have fixed the beads with help of glue on the lamps. Let it dry. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 7: Yellow Lamp Another traditional design is the running curves. I have used a contrast red paint for the curves on the yellow base. Red beads are used here to enhance the effect of contrast. The inner base of Yellow lamp I have used gold dust. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 8: Green Lamp Paisley (Mango) design is one of the most popular traditional design. It is used garments and shawls. For the green base I have used Yellow paint to highlight the Paisley design. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 9: Prepare the Oil Lamp Dip the Cotton wick with oil. If using cotton cloth roll it and dip it in oil. Fill the oil lamp with oil just enough. I have used coconut oil here. I have seen people use many types of oil such as castor oil Olive oil and Vegetable oil. So you can use any type of oil which gives you good brightness. In my case I have got the desired illumination I wanted with coconut Oil. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Step 10: Light It! Light the lamp with a match stick or a candle. Enjoy the illumination. When I see the Diya lit it looks so peaceful and elegant. Note: If you want to reuse your diya you can use tea light candles instead of filling the lamps with oil and wick. The tea light candles should fit into the diya base. Add Tip Ask Question Comment Download Share Did you make this project? Share it with us! I Made It!

If you’ve been wondering how to make a kite it’s really not as hard as it seems and it’s definitely worth the time. Here’s how we made our own kite using newspaper! Follow our Outdoor Play and Learning Pinterest board! (This post contains affiliate links.) MY LATEST VIDEOS Flying kites is one of our favorite things to do as a family. (We actually have this little pocket kite we keep in our bag of beach toys to use when we’re at the beach.) I love watching the kids try to get their kites up in the air and seeing the joy in their faces as they fly their kites! Since my kids have been so into creating this summer I decided to see if we could make our very own kites! I cannot even put into words how much fun we had building them together and taking them to a nearby field to fly them. It was literally hours of running around and laughing and FUN! How to Make a Kite Materials for Making a Kite A full sheet of newspaper Two 1/4 inch round wooden dowels (one 24 inches one 20 inches) Scissors Pencil String Masking tape or packing tape Ruler or yardstick Yarn and/or ribbons Little handsaw Directions for Making a Kite 1. Start by cutting your wooden dowels to the correct lengths- 24 inches and 20 inches. (The kids helped me measure the dowels with a yardstick and I cut them myself with the saw.) 2. Use your handsaw to make notches in both ends of your two wooden dowels. (For safety reasons I did this myself.) 3. Lay the 24 inch dowel vertical and measure 6 inches from the top. Mark it with a pencil. Place the smaller dowel across this mark to form a ‘t’ shape. Use your string to wrap the dowels together where they meet. Pay attention to the notches at the end of each dowel. You’ll want them all parallel to the floor your sticks are on so that you can later wrap string around the frame. Place some masking tape over the string to secure your dowels. 4. W rap string all the way around the kite making sure it goes right into the notches. Now that your frame is done it’s time to add your newspaper. (You can also use a plastic trash bag.) 5. Place a large sheet of newspaper on the floor. Place your frame on top of it. Cut about one inch outside the frame to make your newspaper the same shape. 6. Fold the edges of the newspaper over the string and tape them down securely. 7. Cut a piece of string 24 inches long. Poke holes into the top and bottom points of the kite. Tie one end of the string into the top hole and one end into the bottom hole. (Use some tape to keep it secure.) This is the brindle of your kite. Tie your flying string to this brindle string to fly your kite. (We started by tying the string about 1/3 of the way down the brindle and adjusted it as we flew our kite.) Here you can see the brindle string running along to the top edge of the dowel rod. It’s been tied and taped down. (The other string along the bottom was just an extension of when I wrapped the string around the frame. It’s not necessary at all.) 8. Use ribbon to create a tail for your kite. Now you’re ready to go kite flying! Flying Our Homemade Kite Tip : Be sure to bring some scissors tape and string with you when you go out to fly your kite. We made all kinds of adjustments to get our kites into the air! Flying our homemade kites was one of my favorite memories from this summer! We literally ran around for hours working on getting our kites up in the air! Kite flying required all kinds of teamwork. Here’s Lucy and Theo about to try to get Lucy’s plastic trash bag kite up! Somehow our newspaper kite survived crashing and being dragged around the ground many times. It was a lot stronger than it seemed! Perseverance paid off! Theo was SO proud when he finally got it off the ground! This really was such a fun family activity. It would be a great way to end your summer or a fun way to reconnect on the weekends! This would also be a great science activity for homeschoolers or upper grade classrooms! Find more STEM activities in our ebook! Learn more about it here or b uy it now here !

WHERE TO WATCH News Exclusive News Views Diwali: Significance of a Diya 23249 Views Updated: Nov 06 2012 17:08 PM IST Gayatri Sankar @SankarGayatri A proud vegetarian and an animal lover - Gayatri Sankar is a writer by day and a spiritual seeker otherwise. Photography and music add value to her life while travelling enriches her views about people cultures and traditions. ​ Gayatri Sankar A diya or an earthen lamp is synonymous to the festival of Deepavali or Diwali. Diyas adorn every corner of the house on this very auspicious day and add fervour to the festive spirit which is accompanied by a number of delicacies to gorge on bright and new clothes to wear splash of rangoli on the floor and above all a time for families and friends to get together. As we all know Deepavali meaning ‘row of lamps (Deepon ki avali) is celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil. The people of Ayodhya had welcomed the return of Lord Ram his consort Sita and brother Lakshman who were in exile for 14 long years. Lord Ram Lakshman Lord Hanuman and an army of monkey under the leadership of Vanar Raj Sugreeva had defeated Ravana the king of Lanka who had abducted Sita. And that signified the triumph of good over evil. However there’s something more symbolic about the diyas or jyot . Most Hindu households often light a diya once every morning and in the evening. It’s not just a customary practice but signifies the submission of one’s soul to the supreme power. The oil in the diya represents the dirt (greed jealousy hatred lust etc) that humans tend to nurture while the cotton wick is symbolic of the aatman (self). So in order to attain enlightenment and unite with the Brahman (the supreme power) one must get rid of materialism. A diya emits light when the wick fuelled by oil burns. Moreover a Diya also symbolises knowledge. An ignorant person would often remain in dark and wouldn’t be able to keep a check on the events happening around him. It is only when he feels the need to gain some knowledge that he will realise the purpose of his existence. And hence in this case a diya/jyot signifies the removal of ignorance through knowledge. The following mantra in Sanskrit throws light on the path one must adopt to attain peace and it highlights the importance of jyoti (light): Asato maa sad-gamaya (Lead us from Untruth to Truth) Tamaso maa jyotir-gamaya (From Darkness to Light) Mrityor-maa-mritan gamaya (From Death to Immortality) OM shaanti shaanti shaanti (OM peace peace peace) So a Diya doesn’t merely represent a decorative item but reminds one and all to give up their materialistic desires defeat their ignorance by gaining knowledge if they wish to merge with God.

Indian households will light up with clay lamps candles and electric decorations. Fireworks will fill up the streets and the sky. And we will eat sumptuous Indian food to celebrate the Festival of Lights. Diwali or Deepavali. _____ Indian households particularly Bengali homes practically spend their days and nights thinking about eating. At least that’s how it used to be when we grew up. The day begins planning for food: breakfast around 7 A.M. followed by lunch (around 10 A.M. on weekdays and 1 P.M. on weekends) followed by afternoon snacks (around 4 P.M. when kids return from school) followed by evening snacks (around 7 P.M. when kids return from playground and the head of the household returns from work) followed by dinner (around 10 P.M.). There are some Indian families where dinner is really late: around midnight. Believe it or not! Not good for health though. Of course today with more health consciousness and less available time life has become “less exciting” when it comes to having many meals and munches throughout the day. Let’s talk about breakfast. Breakfast used to be fun. Not like today’s routine cereal and milk or toast and eggs — in affluent Westernized families; or no breakfast in a very busy nuclear family where everybody would go out to work at 8 A.M. sharp. Laid-back were those days when we grew up. Father would work in government office with a stable and peaceful lifelong job and mother would stay at home. Father would plan with mother the night before what next morning’s breakfast would be. Weekdays and weekends just for the simple reason that one has more time than the other would have different sorts of breakfast. On a regular weekday father would go out to work at 10 A.M. (and in my case my mother would also go out to work more or less at the same time unless she had morning duties at the post office where she worked all her life). Therefore breakfast would be made between 7 and 7.30 A.M. Weekday breakfast would include leftover roti (handmade wheat bread) from last night; but in order to make it delicious mother would fry it with ghee on a flat skillet. The roti would turn dark brown but father would take special supervisory role to make sure mother would not over-fry it so that it turned black. Once it turned even remotely blackish it’s no fun to munch on it anymore. It’s bitter. This ghee-fried crispy and crunchy golden brown roti would be savored with some cane sugar sugarcane or date-palm jaggery or for the less-sweet-toothed Indian style mango relish or achaar or even leftover curry warmed up on the clay oven. For the more Westernized but less affluent French toast but not with pricy eggs but with a batter made out of chickpea flour of besan . Equally delicious and nutritious but less harmful to heart. Eat a few pieces of besan French toast with a dash of salt and pepper. Luchi or Puri. Weekend breakfast would be elaborate . Luchi (deep-fried white-flour puffy bread) Paratha (triangular bread fried on a flat skillet with ghee or oil) served with very thinly sliced potato fries. Especially in summer fried Patol (a delicate vegetable of the cucumber family) or in winter fried cauliflower. In families where they have health restrictions on use of oil or ghee they would make a spicy curry with all of the above vegetables with minimal oil (not mustard or coconut oil both of which are high in cholesterol). Fried Patol or pointed gourd. Parval in Hindi. No breakfast is complete without some sweets. In Bengal Mohan Bhog (in Hindi they call it Halva ) would be a major treat for kids and adults alike. It is made out of semolina and ghee with generous amount of cane sugar added to it. Once in a while perhaps a few mouth-watering Ras-Gollah or Gulab Jamun . Then after breakfast it’s time to ponder carefully about the lunch menu. Time for the family member who has time to go to the local farmer’s market or bazaar a very important daily ritual for most Indian households even today. Here is a Mukti’s Kitchen recipe for you a gift on Diwali . Poha (Flattened Rice with cauliflower cashews and raisins) Poha is originally a Marathi-Gujarati dish (from the Western states of Maharashtra and Gujarat) a popular vegetarian breakfast with a fragrant nutty flavor. I made this in my in-laws house with the supervision of my father-in law. He travelled across India and he introduced me to many vegetarian dishes. I still remember my First Poha making and getting nervous whether it would come out nice. Especially in your new home where people are watching over your cooking skills. You have to make sure your flattened rice is not sticky. It must be fluffy and that is the trick. Poha a delicious breakfast. Poha (a Bengali modification) Prep time – 15 minutes Cook time – 20 minutes Total time – 35 minutes Yield – 4-6 people Ingredients 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil 1 tablespoon of ghee (clarified butter) 1 medium red onion finely diced 3 tablespoons of cauliflower (very small florets about 1”/1” cut) ½ cup frozen peas 2 tablespoons of roasted cashew 2 tablespoons of golden raisins 2 cups of soaked flattened rice 1 teaspoon of salt ½ tablespoon of sugar 1 teaspoon of roasted cinnamon cardamom and clove mixture (directions in procedure) Chopped cilantro Procedure How to soak the poha Wash 2 cups of flattened rice in cold water and add 3 cups of warm water. Give it a good swirl. Soak in warm water for 3-5 minutes then drain the extra water completely and let it sit for 4-5 minutes. This part is tricky to make your poha fluffy. Indian spice box How to roast spices In a clean pan add two inches of cinnamon 5 green cardamoms 7 cloves. Let them toast in a medium heat until you get a nice aroma (hold up the pot to look for the fumes coming from spices it should only take 10-20 seconds it is important not to burn your spices.) Transfer the whole spices and grind them in a spice grinder until granular. Now the actual cooking process Heat the oil and ghee on a large skillet on medium flame and add the finely diced onion. Add ½ teaspoon of salt and cauliflower then fry together for 3-4 minutes. Add the peas and stir well and fry for 1 minute. Cook until the vegetables are soft; then add cashews and raisins. Add the flattened rice and softly fold it (gently not to mash the cooked vegetables and rice). Add 1 teaspoon of cardamom cinnamon and clove toasted powder and sugar; mix well then salt to taste. Serve a on a flat plate garnished with ½ teaspoon of toasted powder (cinnamon cardamom and cloves) ½ teaspoon of ghee and chopped cilantro. Serve hot. Happy Diwali to All.

Family See Badges LogOut 7338 Articles Diwali Diwali or Dipawali is India 's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians. The festival gets its name from the row of clay lamps that Indians light outside their homes.

Photograph by Kaphoto Dreamstime Click the full-screen arrows in the upper right for more information! Over the centuries Diwali has become a national festival that is enjoyed by most Indians regardless of faith: Hindus Jains Buddhists and Sikhs. Hindus interpret the Diwali story based upon where they live: In northern India they celebrate the story of King Rama's return to Ayodhya after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps. Southern India celebrates it as the day that Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In western India the festival marks the day that Lord Vishnu the Preserver (one of the main gods of the Hindu trinity) sent the demon King Bali to rule the nether world. In all interpretations one common thread rings true— the festival marks the victory of good over evil. Non-Hindu communities have other reasons for celebrating the holiday: In Jainism it marks the nirvana or spiritual awakening of Lord Mahavira on October 15 527 B.C. In Sikhism it marks the day that Guru Hargobind Ji the Sixth Sikh Guru was freed from imprisonment. Around the World Diwali: Festival of Lights - Ep. 6 In India one of the most significant festivals is Diwali or the Festival of Lights. It's a five-day celebration that includes good food fireworks colored sand and special candles and lamps. More India Get facts and photos.
